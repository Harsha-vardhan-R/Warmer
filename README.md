Warmer is a free and open-source "Node-Based Soft Synth Builder" that can closely emulate the sound of analog synths when 
configured properly (hence the name Warmer). It is highly flexible, allowing you to modulate almost everything you see, limited 
only by your imagination and your computer's processing power. Warmer currently includes over 50 nodes that can be used to create 
countless custom configurations. These can be abstracted by creating your own instruments, displaying only selected parameters to control 
with a custom(User Defined) look.

Currently, Warmer is still under development, with the 1.0.0 alpha release planned for the end of June 2024.
